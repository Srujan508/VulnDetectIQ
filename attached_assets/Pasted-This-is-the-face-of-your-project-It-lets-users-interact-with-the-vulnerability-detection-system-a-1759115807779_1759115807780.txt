This is the "face" of your project. It lets users interact with the vulnerability detection system and intelligent query engine.

🔑 Key Roles of Frontend

Dashboard for admins/security teams

Query interface (like a chatbot or search bar)

Reports & alerts display

User management (login, role-based access, etc.)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Framework → React.js (modern, fast, component-based)

UI Libraries →

TailwindCSS (clean styling, responsive)

ShadCN/UI or Material UI (ready-made components)

Visualization → Charting libraries for graphs and reports:

Chart.js (pie, bar, line charts)

Recharts (integrates well with React)

D3.js (if you want highly customizable visuals)

🖥️ Frontend Modules

Login / Authentication Page (secure login, maybe 2FA)

Dashboard Home

Quick stats → # of vulnerabilities, severity distribution (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

Alerts & Notifications (latest CVEs affecting the system)

Scan Management Page

Start new scan (choose type: network, web, code)

See scan progress in real time

Query Interface (Chatbot Style)

User can type natural language queries like:
“Show me all critical vulnerabilities in the last 30 days”

Results displayed in a table + graph

Reports & Visualization Page

Heatmaps of vulnerable systems

Trend line of vulnerabilities over time

Pie charts for severity distribution

Export options (PDF, CSV)

📊 Visualization & Reporting

This makes raw vulnerability data readable and insightful.

🔑 Key Features

Severity Breakdown → Pie chart (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

Trend Analysis → Line graph (number of new vulnerabilities per week/month)

System Risk Map → Heatmap showing which servers/apps are most vulnerable

Comparison → Bar chart (before vs. after patching)

Logs & Detailed Reports → Tables + filters + search

🛠️ Tools for Visualization

Grafana (enterprise-level dashboards, can integrate with ElasticSearch/Postgres)

Kibana (works with Elasticsearch, powerful for logs & security data)

Custom React Dashboards (using Recharts/Chart.js for SIH demo)

📄 Why Visualization Matters (for SIH judges)

Raw vulnerability logs = boring 😴

Visual dashboards = impactful 🚀

Judges can instantly see trends and risks

Professional touch → exportable PDF reports for CIOs/CISOs

👉 So, your Frontend + Visualization Layer is basically the Control Center of your system:

Query + Interaction → Chatbot / Search bar

Monitoring → Dashboards & alerts

Reporting → Graphs, PDFs, CSVs

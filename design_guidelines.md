# Design Guidelines: Centralized Vulnerability Detection Interface

## Design Approach
**Selected Approach:** Design System Approach using **Material Design 3** principles
**Justification:** This is a utility-focused, data-heavy enterprise application where efficiency, learnability, and professional presentation are paramount. Material Design 3 provides excellent support for content-rich applications with strong visual feedback systems essential for security dashboards.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Dark Mode (Primary):**
- Primary: 220 100% 60% (blue for security/trust)
- Secondary: 240 15% 20% (dark gray backgrounds)
- Background: 240 10% 5% (near black)
- Surface: 240 15% 12% (cards/panels)
- Error: 0 70% 55% (critical vulnerabilities)
- Warning: 45 100% 60% (high severity)
- Success: 120 50% 50% (resolved/safe status)

**Light Mode:**
- Primary: 220 100% 45%
- Background: 0 0% 98%
- Surface: 0 0% 100%
- Text: 240 15% 15%

### B. Typography
**Font Stack:** Inter (Google Fonts)
- Headers: Inter 600 (semibold) for dashboard titles
- Body: Inter 400 (regular) for data tables and content
- Code/Technical: JetBrains Mono for vulnerability IDs and technical details
- Sizes: text-sm for tables, text-base for content, text-lg/xl/2xl for headers

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Framework:** Tailwind units of 2, 4, 6, and 8
- Component padding: p-4, p-6
- Section margins: m-4, m-8
- Grid gaps: gap-4, gap-6
- Card spacing: space-y-4

### D. Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Top navigation bar with user profile and notifications
- Collapsible sidebar with security-focused iconography
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep dashboard sections

**Data Display:**
- Cards with subtle borders and shadows for vulnerability summaries
- Data tables with sortable headers and row highlighting
- Status badges with color-coded severity levels (Critical/Red, High/Orange, Medium/Yellow, Low/Green)
- Progress bars for scan completion status

**Forms & Controls:**
- Search bar with advanced filtering dropdowns
- Date range selectors for time-based queries
- Toggle switches for scan types and monitoring settings

**Visualization:**
- Pie charts using consistent severity color scheme
- Line graphs with subtle grid lines for trend analysis
- Heatmap cards with intensity-based color gradients
- Minimal, data-focused chart styling without decorative elements

**Query Interface:**
- Chat-like interface with message bubbles
- Input field with query suggestions and autocomplete
- Results displayed in structured cards below conversation

### E. Visual Hierarchy
- High contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliant)
- Consistent elevation system using subtle shadows
- Clear visual separation between dashboard sections
- Prominent CTAs for critical security actions

## Interaction Patterns
- Hover states with subtle opacity changes
- Loading states with skeleton components for data fetching
- Toast notifications for system alerts and scan completions
- Modal dialogs for detailed vulnerability information

## Professional Enterprise Aesthetic
- Clean, minimal interface prioritizing data readability
- Consistent spacing and alignment throughout
- Professional color scheme appropriate for C-suite presentations
- Export-ready visualizations suitable for security reports

This design system ensures the vulnerability detection interface maintains professional credibility while providing security teams with efficient, readable access to critical information.
